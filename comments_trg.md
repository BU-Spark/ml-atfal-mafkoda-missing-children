## fall23/README.md

The top level `README.md` needs to be the up-to-date readme for the repo. It is
unchanged from previous term. Seems the new work is all in folder `fall23`, 
including a new readme. At the very least that should be mentioned in the 
top level readme.

`JSON Data File` -- Where does the JSON datafile come from? Where is it?

Answer: There is an example file in the `inputs_outputs` folder and it is mentioned
in the inputs_outputs section. Also added a reference in the first mention 
of the file at the beginning of the readme.
