## Overview

_A brief summary of the project based on initial research and stakeholder meetings. To the best of your abilities, 
explain at a high level the stakeholdersâ€™ desired outcome for the project as well as the potential business value or 
impact this project will have if successfully completed._

### A. Problem Statement: 

*Atfal Mafkoda*, or "missing children" in Arabic, is an organization based in Cairo, Egypt working to reunite missing children, adults, and seniors with their families. There are <insert_statistics> children that went missing from <insert_years> to <insert_years>, and it can be incredibly difficult for volunteers to find these missing children after several years. Children grow up fast, and their facial structures can change drastically in the span of a few years depending on their status (homelessness, scars, hunger, etc.).

To facilitate the search for missing people, our team is developing a face ageing software using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Hopefully, with new images that reflect the current ages and conditions of missing people, our volunteers can help reunite the missing people with their families faster.


### B. Checklist for project completion

_Provide a bulleted list of the concrete deliverables and artifacts that, when complete, define the completion of the
 project._


1. Deliverable 1
2. Deliverable 2


### C. Provide a solution in terms of human actions to confirm if the task is within the scope of automation through AI. 

_To assist in outlining the steps needed to achieve our final goal, outline the AI-less process that we are trying to 
automate with Machine Learning. Provide as much detail as possible._


### D. Outline a path to operationalization.

_Data Science Projects should have an operationalized end point in mind from the onset. Briefly describe how you see the tool
 produced by this project being used by the end user beyond a jupyter notebook or proof of concept. If possible, be specific and
 call out the relevant technologies_
