# About the Notebooks


AgeDBImages.ipynb is similar to POC pipeline, but contains code that will input aged faces and frontalized faces into the database. 
- if using a new database, we recommend running this first. 

DeepFace FR Deployment and Testing.ipynb supersedes DeepFace FR Beta Deployment.ipynb
- in the notebook you will find how to run the Gradio interface along with some ways to test the Facial Recognition power on validation sets. 
- please download the database from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1252bZG0sUNZ_eJZlZKTobUmOLeV9G-nM/view?usp=share_link (embedding vectors are already present in this database, so it should take less than a few minutes to run.)

face_aging_app.ipynb is the Gradio interface for simply aging faces.




*in order to run the notebooks, you must have available GPUs. 
*Some paths may need to be changed.
