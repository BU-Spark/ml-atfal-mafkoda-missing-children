# About the Notebooks


`AgeDBImages.ipynb` is similar to POC pipeline, but contains code that will input aged faces and frontalized faces into the database. 
- if using a new database, we recommend running this first. 

`Facial-Recognition-Demo.ipynb` and `DeepFace-FR-Testing.ipynb` supersede `DeepFace FR Beta Deployment.ipynb`
- in `Facial-Recognition-Demo.ipynb` notebook you will find how to run the Gradio interface
- in `DeepFace-FR-Testing.ipynb` you will see how we tested the facial recognition capabilities (if you would like the testing databases which are different form the main database, please contact us)
- please download the database from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1252bZG0sUNZ_eJZlZKTobUmOLeV9G-nM/view?usp=share_link (embedding vectors are already present in this database, so it should take less than a few minutes to run.)

`face_aging_app.ipynb` is the Gradio interface for simply aging faces.




*in order to run the notebooks, you must have available GPUs. 
*Some paths may need to be changed.
