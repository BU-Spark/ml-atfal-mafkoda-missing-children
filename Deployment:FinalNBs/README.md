# About the Notebooks


*AgeDBImages.ipynb* is similar to the POC pipeline, but contains code that will input aged faces and frontalized faces into the database. 
- If you are using a new database, we recommend running this first. 

*DeepFace FR Deployment and Testing.ipynb* **supersedes** *DeepFace FR Beta Deployment.ipynb*
- In the notebook you will find how to run the Gradio interface along with some ways to test the Facial Recognition power on validation sets. 
- Please download the database [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1252bZG0sUNZ_eJZlZKTobUmOLeV9G-nM/view?usp=share_link) (embedding vectors are already present in this database, so it should take less than a few minutes to run.)

*face_aging_app.ipynb* is the Gradio interface for simply aging faces.


## Notes
* In order to run the notebooks, you must have available GPUs. 
* Some paths may need to be changed.
